# Stack Section
For this section as well as the Queue section we are going to be cheating a slight bit when we discuss the target data structure. For most other sections we will be discussing the C# language provided implementations of a specific data structure of a Microsoft extension. For this and the Queue sections our targeted use case doest benefit from the behavor of what a Stack should be but has a few more technical limitations that required a customer version of the Stack.
